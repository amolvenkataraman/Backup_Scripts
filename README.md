# Backup Scripts

After experiencing catastrophic data loss, I am not taking any chances with data loss anymore, and I have set up scripts on my server to back up all important data so that none of it is lost in case of a drive failure. I am sharing the scripts with everyone because nobody deserves to deal with data loss.
